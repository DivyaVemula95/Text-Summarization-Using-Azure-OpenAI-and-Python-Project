# Text Summarization Using Azure OpenAI and Python
This project involves creating a Python script that leverages Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for summarizing text files. The script enables users to input their Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint, specify the model name, and choose text files to summarize. By reading the text, generating a summary, and writing the output to a specified file, the project aims to streamline the process of extracting concise information from large text files.
